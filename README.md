# Data_Wrangling_Projects

Data Wrangling: Fall term

Data wrangling basically deals with pulling data from various sources and to work with different forms of data. Data wrangling requires a strong knowledge of the data structures that hold datasets. It also deals with tidying of data by sorting, manipulating or summarizing our data.
Data preparation is important before the starting with statistical analysis o the model/ project.
We mainly used SQL for this course and tried to reproduce the data in R as well.
